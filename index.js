// Explicit types

// here in the above example, we've also created a special type that we can after use to declare explicit types
//like in here, you can see what is that explicit type by hoverin on top of it:
var x = ["Hello, michi", 7]; // if you try assigning different value types it will give you an error
// Enums
// they follow a structure similar to the objects
